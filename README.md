# Mission 3: Art Generating Markov Chain 
This project uses a first order Markov Chain to generate a slightly altered version of pixel art. Instead of pixels, a collage like picture made up of dogs is generated -- with each small image of a dog taking the place of a pixel. At the beginning, a first state is randomly selected using a prior probability vector, and each preceeding state is selected based on the probabilities encoded in the transition matrix. 

## Set Up and Running Code. 

1. Go to terminal and clone git repository into a folder on computer  
    ```git clone https://github.com/adrismiller/mission_3.git ```
    
2. Use pip to install necessary requirements for project.  
    ``` pip install -r requirements.txt```
    
3. Navigate to scripts directory through terminal  
    ``` cd scripts ``` 

4. Run generate.py in command line to randomly generate an image.  
    ```python generate.py``` 
    
5. Run with optional arguments: -i string to specify input directory, -od string to specify output directory, -o string to specify output file (jpeg), -s int specify Markov Chain sequence length, -d int specify dimensions of img (img is always square)   
    ```python generate.py -i "input_photos" -od "outputs" -o "my_example_output" -s 400 -d 20```
   
## Discussion of Project 
   ### Personal Meaning 
   This system is personally meaningful to me because of the photos that I used to generate the final art. I collected pictures of my old and current dogs, and the dogs of my family and friends to create pixel art. I also used what I know about the different dogs relationships with eachother to determine the probabilities that I put in the transition matrix. This is what made the final product of the assignment meaningful to me. 
   ## Challenges
   I had some  problems figuring out how to create the final image. A lot of the information I found about pixel art involved Pillow, and I had a difficult attempting to translate that to using images instead of pixels. Eventually I decided to switch to a library that was simpler to use for I what I wanted to do. I had some challenges working with cv2, since it is not super well documented online. I was able to get some challenging practice debugging and problem solving as a computer scientiest.  I also had some challenges because I used pipenv for most of the project. I've worked a little bit with pipenv, but wanted to improve my skills in that area. While I was able to get more comfortable with pipenv, ultimately I decided not to include the Pipfile and related files in the project. Using a requirements.txt file made the download process simpler for others, and I wanted to make the repository easier to use.   Some next steps for this project could be creating the option for a higher order Markov Chain. Right now, there is only a first order Markov Chain, so the probability of entering a certain state depends only on the state immediately before it. I had hoped to implement an option for this in this version of the system, but I wasn't able to with the way that I hard-coded the probabilities. Next steps for this project would also include making the code a little more versatile. Most of the information on the input photos and states is hard coded into the generate.py method, and while it isn't difficult to edit, it could certainly be an easier process.
   ### Creativity 
   The two factors we discussed in our initial definition of creativity was novelty and value in the domain to which the work applies. This project fits that definition in a very specific domain. This system fits our definition of novel -- it expands on pixel art in a unique and interesting way. This project has value to me and my family because we enjoy silly photos and edits of dogs. Another aspect of creativtiy we have discussed is the idea that each generation of art should be unique, and not replicable. All the examples images generated by my system have been uniquely. While it is unlikely that my system would create the same image twice with the default variables (the default length of the Markov Sequence is 400), if a user specified a much smaller length sequence, the art generated would be much less likely to be unique. 
   ## Sources 
   I talked a little bit with Nicole in the beginning stages of the project about what ideas we had for the art part of the system, as well as some specifics in the instructions. I used https://www.includehelp.com/python/create-a-collage-of-images-with-the-help-of-numpy-and-python-opencv-cv2.aspx as a guide to experiment and use cv2 to create my final images. I also used the documentation for common Python libraries (numpy, os). I had worked a little bit with argparse on an old projeect of mine, and used that as a reference for my code involving argparse.
